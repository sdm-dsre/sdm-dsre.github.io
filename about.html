          <p>Retail is the sale of goods and services from a brick-and-mortar business to a consumer for 
              their own use. E-commerce refers to the sale of goods and services via commercial transactions 
              made electronically over the internet. Omnichannel retailing integrates both brick-and-mortar 
              and e-commerce sales channels to provide consumers a flexible retail shopping experience. 
              Global retail sales were US$18.84 trillion of which e-commerce sales accounted for US$ 2.86 trillion
              representing 15.2% web penetration [1]. Similar to other industries, there has been a growing
              interest in leveraging data science and related techniques in retail and e-commerce (Retail E-com)
                to provide a more efficient, convenient and personalized shopping experiences to increase customer
                foot traffic and spend [2] [3]. With the democratization of machine learning and artificial
                  intelligence, there is a great opportunity to bring awareness of Retail E-com to more experts
                  in the SDM community and tackle problems which can have a wide impact in this
                    multi trillion-dollar industry. There are plenty of opportunities to apply data science in
                    the customer retail journey ranging from pre-interaction marketing, product search and
                      recommendations and inventory management, to warehouse operations automation, delivery
                      prediction and customer aftercare.
            </p>
            <p>We expect our 
                    workshop will not only expose current researchers in SDM
                     community to unexplored high impact problems in e-commerce, but also help grow the community
                      by attracting researchers from the broader retail and e-commerce space.
